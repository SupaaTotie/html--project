            <h1>Spike</h1>
                <p>
                  Spike is a Common Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs $180,000 or RB 380
                  from the Blox Fruit Dealer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Spike is not recommended for PvP due to its lack of mobility and combos.
                  It is recommended to use better fruits, such as Elemental fruits like
                  Smoke or Flame. However, it is recommended for grinding in the early First
                  Sea, as its moves are AoE.
                </p>
