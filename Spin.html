            <h1>Spin</h1>
                <p>
                  Spin is a Common Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs $ <br>
                  7,500 or RB 75 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Spin is the second cheapest fruit and is not recommended for use due to
                  its poor performance in both grinding and PvP due to the fact that it only
                  has 4 moves, with only 1 of these being a ranged attack. Many other fruits
                  are better for grinding and PvP alike.

            <h2>Moves</h2>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Z - Razor Wind</li>
                <p>
                  The user spins their arms and makes many wind slashes that do damage to
                  anyone in front of them. It can be held for more damage, and stuns the
                  enemy in place.

                      <li>X - Tornado Assault</li>
                <p>
                  The user spins and unleashes a barrage of air slashes, before unleashing
                  a stronger slash that slightly knocks their opponent back. This move is
                  very similar to Triple Katana Z move.

                  cursor at a slow pace.
