    <h2>GAME BACKGROUND</h2>
        <hr>
            <p>
                Blox Fruits is a simple MMORPG that packages the ‚ÄúOne Piece‚Äù universe into a fun game. Players go through an engagement loop of exploring the map, encountering increasingly difficult enemies, and farming and looting (so they can do more farming). This fits perfectly with the ‚ÄúOne Piece‚Äù storyline, which centers around a carefree pirate on an adventure to find the treasure left behind by a legendary Pirate King. He faces increasingly challenging enemies and finds power-ups and allies who help him overcome those obstacles. The developers do a fantastic job translating the anime‚Äôs key points into game mechanics and creating an outlet for ‚ÄúOne Piece‚Äù fans to explore the story‚Äôs universe with their own unique protagonist.
                Although the game is incredibly popular, it has its fair share of shortcomings, including heavy grinding, limited world-building, a nonexistent tutorial system, and rudimentary UI. The grinding is partially offset by the multiplayer nature of the game, which helps punctuate periods of repetitiveness by meeting friendly players who help you on your journey, and antagonistic ones who try to PvP fight you while you‚Äôre peacefully farming. Players also look past the limited world-building and nonexistent tutorial system, given their intrinsic familiarity with the IP and a robust online community to help explain basic game mechanics.
