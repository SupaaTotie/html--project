        <hr>
               <p>
                 Rocket (formerly known as Kilo) is a Common Natural-type Blox Fruit that
                 costs $5,000 or RB 50 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.
              </p>
              <p>
                 Rocket is the cheapest fruit in the game, with the same cost that Kilo
                 had. However, its attacks are more powerful and better for grinding and
                 (perhaps) PvP due to the skills' decent AoE. Not to mention, it's also
                 affordable for starters.

              <ul>
                  <li>Z - Missile Fist</li>
              <p>
                The user fires a small rocket from their hand, dealing damage and knockback on the contacted opponent.
              </p>

                  <li>x - Air Strike</li>
              <p>
                The user raises their arm and shoots five rockets upwards, before creating targets at their cursor. <br>
                The previously fired rockets then drop onto the targets, dealing decent damage.
              </p>
        <img class="RocketX" src="IMG/X-Key.webp" alt="x move of rocker fruit">
                  <li>C - Rocket Crash</li>
              <p>
                The user jumps to the air at a rapid rate and 
                crashes to the ground where the cursor is pointing, 
                dealing good AoE damage to any contacted enemies. 
                This move is similar to T-Rex's F move (transformed)
                but faster.
              </p>

                  <li>F - Blast Off</li>
              <p>
                The user does a backflip towards the sky and flies at 
                a slow pace with an explosive trail. This move is similar 
                to Flame's 'Rocket Flight' ability.
