                <p>
                  Bomb is a Common Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs $80,000 or RB 220 from
                  the Blox Fruit Dealer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bomb can be used for grinding in the First Sea due to its low mastery
                  requirements, but it is not recommended as it lacks Elemental Reflex. This
                  fruit can be excellent in PvP when used correctly, as most moves have an
                  extremely large AoE and high knockback. However, it is recommended to use
                  other fruits for grinding in Second and Third Sea due to a lack of
                  mobility.

            <h2>Moves</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Z - Targeted Bomb</li>
                <p>
                  The user charges a bomb where the cursor is held. Once the Z key is
                  released, the bomb explodes, dealing damage to enemies and launching
                  them into the air. Holding this move allows you to change the direction
                  and deal more damage as you charge the move.
                </p>

                    <li>X - Bomb Grab</li>
                <p>
                  The user dashes forward, and if the user hits an enemy, it will cause an
                  explosion and fling them forward in the user’s direction. This move is
                  similar to Superhuman/Godhuman [C] moves.
                </p>
        <img src="GIF/Bomb_X.webp" alt="X move of Bomb fruit">
                    <li>C - Land Mines</li>
                <p>
                  The user creates a minefield. The size depends on how long the move is
                  held. If an enemy steps on a land mine, they will be damaged by an
                  explosion. The landmines can only be seen by the user.
                </p>
        <img src="GIF/Bomb_C.webp" alt="C move of Bomb fruit">
                    <li>V - Self Destruct</li>
                <p>
                  If the key is held, the user’s health begins to drain, and they begin
                  charging up an explosion. Upon release of the key, an explosion will
                  occur around the player, dealing immense damage and knockback. Holding
                  longer will cause the move to deal more damage and it can't be cancelled
                  when you take damage. This ability acts like falling into water, but
                  takes less damage. That is, if your Stat fruit is at maximum but your
                  health stat is only 1, when using the move it will still drain your
                  health like falling into water.

                    <li>F - Explosive Jump</li>
                <p>
                  The user jumps into the air, creating two explosions while dealing low
                  damage to any enemies caught in them.
                </p>
