            <h1>Rubber</h1>
                <p>
                  Rubber is a Rare Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs $750,000 or RB 1,200
                  from the Blox Fruit Dealer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rubber turns its user's body into rubber, and grants the user immunity to
                  Rumble, Electric, and Guns. However, it does not grant immunity to
                  Electric Claw, Pole (1st Form) and Pole (2nd Form), even though they are
                  electric-based forms of attack. Rubber is good for grinding because of its
                  long ranged M1s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rubber is good until the player reaches Upper Skylands since most NPCs
                  have ranged attacks and the fruit needs a lot of accuracy. It is still, to
                  a degree, a better option for grinding, than most "regular" Blox Fruits.
