    <h1>BLOXFRUITS INFORMATION</h1>
        <hr>
            <p class="press-start-2p-regular">
                This website was created or published in intending to give information to the players of BLOXFRUITS. <br> 
                This is the official wiki, often known as a hub of knowledge, for the Roblox game Blox Fruits. <br>
                The creators/admins/developers of the game do not manage this wiki, it is managed by Superhugo.

    <h2>Game background</h2>
            <p class="press-start-2p-regular">
                Blox Fruits is a simple MMORPG that packages the “One Piece” universe into a fun game. Players go through an engagement loop of exploring the map, encountering increasingly difficult enemies, and farming and looting (so they can do more farming). This fits perfectly with the “One Piece” storyline, which centers around a carefree pirate on an adventure to find the treasure left behind by a legendary Pirate King. He faces increasingly challenging enemies and finds power-ups and allies who help him overcome those obstacles. The developers do a fantastic job translating the anime’s key points into game mechanics and creating an outlet for “One Piece” fans to explore the story’s universe with their own unique protagonist.
                Although the game is incredibly popular, it has its fair share of shortcomings, including heavy grinding, limited world-building, a nonexistent tutorial system, and rudimentary UI. The grinding is partially offset by the multiplayer nature of the game, which helps punctuate periods of repetitiveness by meeting friendly players who help you on your journey, and antagonistic ones who try to PvP fight you while you’re peacefully farming. Players also look past the limited world-building and nonexistent tutorial system, given their intrinsic familiarity with the IP and a robust online community to help explain basic game mechanics.

    <h2>About me</h2>
            <p class="press-start-2p-regular">
                Welcome to the Bloxfruit Wiki, an academic project created and maintained by me, a dedicated student who is both passionate about gaming and web development. This website is the culmination of countless hours of research, design, and coding, with the goal of providing a comprehensive resource for players of Blox Fruits. My aim is to create a space where both new and experienced players can find useful information about the game’s mechanics, items, abilities, characters, and updates.
                As a solo developer, I took on this project to not only showcase my technical and creative abilities but also to deepen my understanding of the complexities involved in building a structured, user-friendly wiki. From gathering and organizing data to designing a website layout that is easy to navigate, every aspect of this site reflects my dedication and effort.
                It is important to note that this wiki is not intended for public use or sharing on any social platforms. This site is part of an academic project, created to demonstrate my capabilities in website development, research, and content management. It serves as a practical application of what I have learned in my studies, and a way to refine the skills necessary for a future career in technology or content creation.
                Creating this site has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to combine my love for Blox Fruits with the technical challenge of building a resource from scratch. I hope that visitors to the site will find the information useful, but please keep in mind that the primary purpose of this website is academic, and it is not intended to be a public or commercial resource.
                Thank you for taking the time to explore my work and for being a part of this academic journey!
