      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Bloxfruit Wiki, an academic project created and maintained by me, a dedicated student who is both passionate about gaming and web development. This website is the culmination of countless hours of research, design, and coding, with the goal of providing a comprehensive resource for players of Blox Fruits. My aim is to create a space where both new and experienced players can find useful information about the gameâ€™s mechanics, items, abilities, characters, and updates.
            As a solo developer, I took on this project to not only showcase my technical and creative abilities but also to deepen my understanding of the complexities involved in building a structured, user-friendly wiki. From gathering and organizing data to designing a website layout that is easy to navigate, every aspect of this site reflects my dedication and effort.
            It is important to note that this wiki is not intended for public use or sharing on any social platforms. This site is part of an academic project, created to demonstrate my capabilities in website development, research, and content management. It serves as a practical application of what I have learned in my studies, and a way to refine the skills necessary for a future career in technology or content creation.
            Creating this site has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to combine my love for Blox Fruits with the technical challenge of building a resource from scratch. I hope that visitors to the site will find the information useful, but please keep in mind that the primary purpose of this website is academic, and it is not intended to be a public or commercial resource.
            Thank you for taking the time to explore my work and for being a part of this academic journey!
