            <h1>Spring</h1>
                <p>
                  Spring is a Common Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs $60,000 or RB 180
                  from the Blox Fruit Dealer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Spring is arguably of the worst fruits in the game for grinding and PvP.
                  It has surprisingly good mobility, but it's infamously known for being bad
                  because it lacks PvP potential and grinding potential. Other Common fruits
                  such as Chop or Bomb are more highly recommended as they outclass Spring
                  in most scenarios.

                      <li>Z - Knock</li>
                <p>
                  The user's right forearm becomes a spring, launching a punch at the
                  target.

                      <li>X - Spring Snipe</li>
                <p>
                  The user's knees become springs, leaping to where they aimed, and
                  dealing damage when it hits the target.

                      <li>C - Spring Cannon</li>
                <p>
                  The user turns their legs into springs, stretches a decent distance
                  up, and then withdraws, causing a small-sized crater which deals
                  decent damage to enemies.

                      <li>V - Spring Emperor</li>
                <p>
                  The user turns their legs into springs, bouncing around a square-shaped
                  AOE area, hitting the target various times before withdrawing and
                  turning their legs back to normal.
                </p>

                      <li>F - Spring Leap</li>
                <p>
                  The user transforms their legs into springs and leaps. The user can
                  bounce on walls, gaining speed and momentum while doing so.
