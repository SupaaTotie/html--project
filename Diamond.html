            <h1>Diamond</h1>
                <p>
                  Diamond is an Uncommon Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs $600,000 or RB
                  1,000 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Diamond is rarely used in PvP, it can be useful for Sword mains
                  as it provides a valuable defense boost without any hitbox increases
                  (unlike Buddha). That being said, Diamond is not recommended for grinding
                  or for Fruit mains as it only has 3 attack moves which all deal mediocre
                  damage.

                <ul>
                    <li>Z - Encrust</li>
                <p>
                  The user's skin transforms into diamond and radiates shiny halos. This
                  gives a 25% defense buff. (Said in passive)
                </p>

                    <li>X - Beaming Tackle</li>
                <p>
                  The user tackles a nearby NPC or player. If the tackled enemy hits a
                  surface, it creates a crater. The longer the user holds this move, the
                  farther they will be launched. This move is similar to Combat's Quick
                  Tackle.

                    <li>C - Diamond Hail</li>
                <p>
                  The user fires numerous shards from their hands. The amount of shards
                  fired depends on how long the key is held for. This move is similar to
                  Ice's Ice Spears but it fires a larger number of projectiles.
                </p>

                    <li>V - Solar Flare</li>
                <p>
                  The user releases a large AOE blast of light, which deals heavy damage
                  whilst simultaneously blinding nearby enemies in 3 seconds.
