            <h1>Chop</h1>
        <hr>    
                <p>
                  Chop is a Common Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs <br>
                  $30,000 or RB 100 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chop gains value through its passive immunity to sword damage <br>
                  even if they are imbued with Aura, making the user incredibly <br>
                  powerful against those who mainly use swords when it comes to PvP. <br>
                  Unfortunately, most of its skills have little range and sub-par damage,<br>
                  making it best used as a "supporting" Blox Fruit.
